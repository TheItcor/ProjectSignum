Supported languages: English, Russian, (Planned: Spanish, French, German, Polish, Italian, Finnish, Portuguese, Esperanto)

## Features:
* Working in the console. Easy to use.
* Saving logins & passwords with name of service, where it used.
* **SLP-System**: Logins and passwords (with name of the service where they are used) are encrypted and written to a separate file (Service-Login-Password file). When a user requests their SLP files, they are decrypted directly in the program without being saved in decrypted form.
* Generate password of **any** length.

## How to use?
Open Project Signum.bat, choose language, enter "n", then enter your name of service, login and password (or just press Enter it generate password for you). Now in main menu enter "l" and you will be able to see your login and password there.

You can also change the length of the generated password in the settings. 
`Menu > settings > y {number}`


## How does this work?
You enter the data about logins & passwords, it is immediately encrypted and saved on your hard drive. Then when you need it, the data is decrypted and you receive it!
