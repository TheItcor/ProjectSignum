## How does this work?
You enter the data about logins & passwords, it is immediately encrypted and saved on your hard drive. Then when you need it, the data is decrypted and you receive it!



## Alpha dev (100% Done)
* Main feature - encrypt your data
* SLP-files (Service-Login-Password)
* Main menu with settings
* Password generator
* Added and removed translations (lol). It's only russian language for now



## Beta dev (work in progress)
* Translations in English & Spanish
* Cosmetics features
* More!



## Release dev (in future...)
* New encryption-tech for user's data.
* Obusfaction for safety.
* Maybe window-app.
